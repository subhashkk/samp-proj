  "readme": "# `voya-stub-server`\n![Image of voya-stub-server UI](screenshot.png)\n\nDEV NOTE: This package is ES2015/ES2016, it must be compiled before release. `npm run prepublish`.\n\n## Features\n\n   - Allows creation of 'presets', which are saved configurations of active stubs\n   - Exposes API for usage with tests\n   - Watches stub directory for changes, and always shows the updated stub\n\n## Usage\n\nIn your project\n```\n$ npm install git+ssh://git@github.voya.net:Voya/voya-stub-server.git\n```\n\n`voya-stub-server` will automatically create the `/server/local` directory in your project.\n\n### Plain JS\n\n`voya-stub-server` returns a `Promise` when invoked. This promise is resolved when the server has successfully started.\n\n`@param config.port` port number to run on.\n\n`@param config.paths` static paths to serve.\n\n`@param callback` optional, with signature of `(error, server)`, where `server` is an instance of the express server.\n\n```js\nvar server = require('voya-stub-server');\n\nserver({port: 9000, paths: ['.']});\n```\n\n### Gulp\n```js\nvar server = require('voya-stub-server');\n\n// dev server\ngulp.task('server', function () {\n    return server({port: 9000, paths: ['.']});\n})\n\n// dist server\ngulp.task('server:dist', function () {\n    return server({port: 9000, paths: ['./dist']});\n});\n```\n\n## Using the interface\n\nNavigate to `/services`. Here you will be able to set the active stub for each route.\n\n### Stubs\n\nBy default, `voya-stub-server` expects your stubs to be in `/server/local/stubs`.\n\n### Presets\n\nBy default, `voya-stub-server` expects your presets to be in `/server/local/presets`.\n\nYou can create presets in two ways:\n\n   1. In the interface, set all of the stubs to their desired positions. At the top of the page, enter a name\n   for the preset and click 'Save config as preset'. You should now see your preset in the presets dropdown\n    \n   2. Create a new json file in the presets directory. As soon as the file is added, you should see it in\n   the presets dropdown.\n\n### Environment Configurations\n\nBy default, `voya-stub-server` expects your environment configurations to be in `/server/local/environments`.\n\nWith environment configurations, you can configure proxy server middleware to map local paths to a remote paths.  Here is an example setup.\n\n/server/local/environments/local.json\n```\n[]\n```\n\n/server/local/environments/unit.json\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"path\": \"/voyasso\",\n    \"target\": \"https://my2.unit.voya.com\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n/server/local/environments/some-developers-machine.json\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"path\": \"/voyasso\",\n    \"target\": \"http://wp3werw232:8080\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Endpoint documentation\n\nYou shouldn't ever need to directly call any of the endpoints -- use the interface instead.\nBut here is the documentation.\n\n#### `GET /services`\n\nShows the mock services index\n\n#### `GET /services/setStub`\n\nSets the default stub for a route\n\n`@param route` the route to configure\n\n`@param stub` the name of the stub to make default\n\n#### `GET /services/setPreset`\n\nApplies a preset. Selects all stubs defined in the preset.\n\n`@param name` the name of the preset to apply\n\n#### `GET /services/reset`\n\nResets all active stubs to their original values.\n\n#### `POST /services/createPreset`\n\nCreates a preset with the current stub configuration. Saves it in `/server/local/presets`\n\n`@param name` the desired name for this stub\n",
